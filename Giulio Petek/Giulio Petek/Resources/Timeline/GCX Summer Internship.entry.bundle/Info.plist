	<string>Summer Internship</string>
	<key>text</key>
	<string>After building EtchPad I knew that I really love to develop iOS applications. And if you love something you always struggle to become better. By searching for internships on various platforms I quickly got an offer by grandcentrix. back then it was located in a rather small office in cologne. There were only around 10 employees.

My first task was to build a component which displays a navigation tree like UITableView. The requirement included that it is fillable via a remote server. After some initial troubles I got along pretty quickly and then could continue working on an Application for Sparkasse, a German bank institute. This task turned out to be far more interesting than the previous one. I had to build a complete chat kit. This includes UI and data persistence, no network connections though. After my internship the grandcentrix team and I decided to keep in touch. It was a great experience and definitely a step towards the right direction.</string>
