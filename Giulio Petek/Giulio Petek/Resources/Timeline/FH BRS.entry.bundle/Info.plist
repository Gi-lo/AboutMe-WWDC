	<string>After my final examinations I decided to study computer science at the University of Applied Science Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. 

The first semester included subjects like theoretical computer science where we discussed complexity, automatas and language classes. For me, a completely different, yet interesting aspect of computer science. Besides that I had to learn Java and some basics of physics and math. 

I plan graduating with a bachelors in two and a half years. Afterwards I may do my masters which normally takes four more semesters.</string>
