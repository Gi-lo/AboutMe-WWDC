	<string>A friend of mine and I decided to build an application for the brand new iPad. As he enjoyed playing Etch-a-Sketch as child we decided to bring back some good old childhood memories. Though the application was rejected due copyright issue it was a still a great learning experience. Diving deeper in CoreGraphics and custom UIControls was a clever choice.
EtchPad features two rotary knobs for vertical and horizontal line movement. There is also an undo function as well as the possibility to export and share your drawing.</string>
